    "On my first attempt, my preprocessed data had 43 inputs. I created a neural network with input_dim of 43, 2 hidden layers with 100 units each, and 10 epochs. I chose 100 units as a value because it is advisable to start with a number 2 to 3 times as big as the input dimension. 2 layers and 10 epochs were a modest and sensible starting point for benchmarking. Relu was the activation function for all of the layers except the last one, which used sigmoid. \n",

    "While decent, this result did not meet our desired threshold of 75% accuracy.  To address this, I fed the keras-tuner in Google Colaboratory all of the same specifications from above, hoping for a promising lead on the best model. Its output for the best model could not be replicated with the specifications it suggested, but they led me to experiment with similar settings. I ended up running 100 epochs with an input layer of 9 units in relu activation, and 2 hidden layers of 9 units, one in relu and one in tanh activation. The output layer used the sigmoid function.  With these parameters, I was able to achieve this performance:\n",
